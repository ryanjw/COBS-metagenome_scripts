COBS-Metagenome_Parsing_Instructions

These are instructions for how I've been parsing data from the COBS-Metagenome dataset based on SEED annotations of all contigs.

1.  Use the make_reference_list.R to make a .txt file that is just the contigs that you need
2.	Upload the ref file to wherever the parsing is going to be run (in Desktop/RJW_KBASE/list_to_dict_search for example)
3. run the python script parse_by_contig_list.py 'abundance summary file' 'reference list file' > 'parsed contigs file' (MAKE SURE THIS IS RUN IN ANOTHER SCREEN)

Ex.

python parse_by_contig_list.py ../abundance-summary2.txt ./reference_list_pMMO.txt > parsed_pMMO_contigs.txt
